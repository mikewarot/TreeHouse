TreeHouse - A structure build in a tree, for habitation

Based on ideas seen at https://media.handmade-seattle.com/dion-systems/

Also based on ideas I've had forever... but couldn't get passed the UI issues on

Basically, a tree is maintained internally that IS the abstract syntax tree that source code gets compiled to, and source code gets generated as a view from this tree.
